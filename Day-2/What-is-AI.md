## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence, means making computers or machines do tasks that typically need human intelligence.

- Voice Assistants
- Recommendation Systems
- Autocorrect and Predictive Text

## Key characteristics of AI
### 1.  Learning
---
AI systems can learn and adapt from data or experiences, improving their performance over time. This is often referred to as machine learning.
- Email Spam Filters
- Language Translation
- Self-Driving Cars

### 2.  Reasonings
---
AI can use logic and rules to make decisions and solve problems. It can process information and draw conclusions based on available data. 
- Weather Forecasting
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Medical Diagnosis
### 3.  Self correction
---
Self-correction in AI is when a machine or AI system can recognize and correct its own errors or mistakes without human intervention.
- Grammar Correction
- Speech Recognition
- Automatic Image Enhancement
### 4.  Adaptablity
---
Adaptability in AI refers to the capability of artificial intelligence systems to adjust to changing conditions, learn from new data, and improve their performance over time.
- Personalized Recommendations
- Smart Thermostats
- E-commerce Personalization

### 5. Natural language processing
---
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the inteaction between computers and human language.
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Summarization
### 6. Computer vision
---
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, just as humans do with their eyes.
- Facial Recognition
- Barcode Scanners
- Medical Imaging

## Types of AI (Capablity based)
### 1. Narrow or Weak AI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence - ANI):
---
Narrow AI is designed for a specific task or a narrow range of tasks. It's highly specialized and cannot perform tasks outside of its designated scope. 
- virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa
-  chatbots
-   image recognition software

### 2. General AI (Artificial General Intelligence - AGI):
---
General AI refers to a type of AI that has the ability to understand, learn, and perform any intellectual task that a human can do. AGI would possess human-like intelligence and could apply its knowledge to a wide range of tasks, making it highly adaptable. True AGI doesn't exist yet, and creating it is a significant challenge in AI research.
- Medical diagnosis: AGI could be used to analyze medical data and diagnose diseases with the same accuracy as a human doctor.
- Financial analysis: AGI could be used to analyze financial data and make investment decisions with the same accuracy as a human financial analyst.
- Autonomous driving: AGI could be used to enable self-driving cars to navigate roads and make decisions in real-time, just like a human driver.
### 3. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):
---
Artificial Superintelligence is a theoretical concept where AI surpasses human intelligence in every aspect, including problem-solving, creativity, and social understanding. ASI, if achieved, could potentially outperform the brightest human minds in all areas of intellectual work. It's a topic of debate and concern due to its potential impact on society.

## Types of AI (Functionality based)

### 1. Reactive Machines:
---
Reactive machines are AI systems that operate based on predefined rules and do not have the ability to learn from past experiences. They make decisions and perform tasks based on a fixed set of instructions.
- Chess-playing programs
- IBM's Deep Blue, 

### 2. Limited Memory AI:
---
Limited memory AI systems have the ability to learn from historical data and past experiences to some extent. They can make decisions based on this learned information but may not have the capability to continuously adapt or generalize well to new situations. 
- Self-driving cars often fall into this category, as they learn from data but can encounter challenges in novel scenarios.

### 3. Theory of Mind AI:
---
Theory of Mind AI is a concept where AI systems would be designed to understand and interpret the emotions, intentions, and beliefs of humans. While this is more of a theoretical idea, it could be crucial for AI systems that interact with humans in complex social settings.

### 4. Self-aware AI:
---
Self-aware AI, also known as Artificial Consciousness, is a hypothetical type of AI that has self-awareness, consciousness, and subjective experiences. This type of AI, if achievable, would possess a level of consciousness similar to humans, which is currently a topic of philosophical and scientific debate.
