## Types of AI (Functionality based)

### 1. Reactive Machines:
---
Reactive machines are AI systems that operate based on predefined rules and do not have the ability to learn from past experiences. They make decisions and perform tasks based on a fixed set of instructions.
- Chess-playing programs
- IBM's Deep Blue, 

### 2. Limited Memory AI:
---
Limited memory AI systems have the ability to learn from historical data and past experiences to some extent. They can make decisions based on this learned information but may not have the capability to continuously adapt or generalize well to new situations. 
- Self-driving cars often fall into this category, as they learn from data but can encounter challenges in novel scenarios.

### 3. Theory of Mind AI:
---
Theory of Mind AI is a concept where AI systems would be designed to understand and interpret the emotions, intentions, and beliefs of humans. While this is more of a theoretical idea, it could be crucial for AI systems that interact with humans in complex social settings.

### 4. Self-aware AI:
---
Self-aware AI, also known as Artificial Consciousness, is a hypothetical type of AI that has self-awareness, consciousness, and subjective experiences. This type of AI, if achievable, would possess a level of consciousness similar to humans, which is currently a topic of philosophical and scientific debate.
